## About me

Hello everyone! My name is Maxime Thibodeau and I've been working in law enforcement since 2012, more specifically in digital forensics since 2019. I discovered a passion for the field and since then, I've been racking up courses and certifications without counting the time. For more than a year, I wanted to start a blog to documents my findings. 

My blog will cover a range of topics, such as DFIR discoveries, CTF write-ups, tools that I uses and general documentation. I do not intend to reach a large audience, but if this blog helps a least one person, it would have serve his purpose. Feel free to reach me at anytime!
